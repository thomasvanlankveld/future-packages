# Cassette Deck Roadmap

## Challenges

#### Automatically apply application version changes.

Will require the project to be set up with powerful build automation.

- Do git checkouts based on versions?
- Specify a task runner and tasks to run?
- Reversible tasks?
Idea: source not only the application version, but also the commit hash. ([PHP Git Wrapper](https://github.com/cpliakas/git-wrapper))
